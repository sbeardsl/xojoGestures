Turn off "Simple References":
To to "Build Settings: Shared"
Under "Build" turn "Simple References" to OFF

Now build and you will be able to see the actual errors

From this point you will just need to clean up API 2.0 related issues.

Some of the common ones I had to fix in ExampleOne:

Date -> DateTime

Xojo.Core.Point -> Xojo.Point

Strange, I found a LOT of "xojo . Core . Point" <<< note the spaces
Many of these are tucked in hard to see locations, do a Find: xojo . Core . Point and replace with Xojo.Point or you will get strange results

You can assign a String directly to a CString so you can now do:

Dim sMyString = "Hello World"
Dim sMyStringAsCString as CString = sMyString

Then all the rest of the API 2.0 fixup

iosView -> MobileScreen (Open Event -> Opening Event, Invalidate -> Refresh, ect)
iosControl -> MobileControl
iosGraphics -> Graphics  (LineWidth -> PenSize, DrawRect -> DrawRectangle, FillColor -> DrawingColor, FillRect -> FillRectangle, ect)
iosButton -> MobileButton (Action Event -> Pressed)
and anything else you run into
